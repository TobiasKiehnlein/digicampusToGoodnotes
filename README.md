#Digicampus to GoodNotes Downloader

##General
There is a new Feature released called "Email to GoodNotes". This feature will be used to automatically download and send the files from digicampus to your GoodNotes Application.
To do so you simply have to setup the config.json correctly (as explained in the next section) and let it run on your Raspberry Pi or wherever you want.
Then your files will be imported automatically to your GoodNotes main directory.

##Configuration
There is an example file included. Just rename it to config.json and change it as you like

* to: GoodNotes Email-Adress
* username: RZ-username
* password: RZ-password
* blacklist: contains keys to blacklist certain unwanted courses or files
